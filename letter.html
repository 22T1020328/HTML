    <h2><b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b></h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
     Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br> of your <u>PhD</u> next year.
     I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    <br>
    <h2><b>Starting dates</b></h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
    </p>
    <p>You can find more information about <u><a href="important university dates">important university dates</a></u> on our website.</p>
    <h2><b>Subjects of study</b></h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub> H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the<br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>
        <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Exotic dance moves</b></h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>, a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
            </dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> modern styles such as Twerking.
            </dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br> discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.
            </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
